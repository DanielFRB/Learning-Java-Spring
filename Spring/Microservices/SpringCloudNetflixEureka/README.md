# SpringBoot Microservices Communication Example using Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka.

We will learn how to use SpringCloud Netflix Eureka for Service Registry and Discovery.
We can use Netflix Eureka Server to create a Service Registry and make our microservices
(department-service and user-service) as Eureka Clients so that as soon as we start a microservice 
it will get registered with Eureka Server automatically with a logical Service ID.
